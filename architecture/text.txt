_Conceptual Architecture_

1. Components:

•Frontend (React):
 -Home component
 -List component

•Backend (Spring Boot):
 -Controller
 -Service
 -Repository
 -Model

2.Interaction:

 -Frontend interacts with the Backend through RESTful APIs.
 -React components communicate with each other through routing.


_Execution Architecture_

1. Flow:

 •The frontend makes API calls to the backend for data retrieval and manipulation.
 •Backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and sends responses.

2. Data Flow:

 •Data flows from the H2 database to the Spring Boot backend.
 •React components retrieve and display data fetched from the backend.

_Implementation Architecture_

1.Backend (Spring Boot):

•Model:
 -Represents entities stored in the database.
 -Annotated with @Entity, @Data, @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor.

•Repository:
 -Interface extending JpaRepository for database operations.

•Service:
Implements business logic, interacts with the repository.

•Controller:
-Defines RESTful endpoints, interacts with the service.

•Database Configuration:
-Configures the connection to the H2 database in application.properties.

2.Frontend (React):

 •Components:
-Home component for the home page.
-List component for displaying the list of items.

•Routing:
-Uses React Router for navigation between different screens.

•State Management:
-Utilizes useState to manage component state.
-Uses useEffect to fetch data from backend APIs.

•API Integration:
-Fetches data from Spring Boot backend using fetch.
